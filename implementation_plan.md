# Implementation Plan - DistRunner Viva Preparation

## Goal Description
The goal is to provide the user with a comprehensive workflow and guide to prepare for their viva presentation of the DistRunner project. This includes a step-by-step demo script, explanation of key technical concepts, and answers to potential questions.

## User Review Required
None. This is a new document creation.

## Proposed Changes
### Documentation
#### [NEW] [viva_preparation.md](file:///c:/Users/HP/Downloads/DistRunner/DistRunner/viva_preparation.md)
- **Project Overview**: Elevator pitch and high-level architecture.
- **Demo Script**: Step-by-step commands to run a successful demonstration (Server + 2 Agents + Dashboard).
- **Technical Deep Dive**: Explanation of distribution logic, plugins, and PDC concepts (Amdahl's law, Speedup).
- **Q&A Section**: Common questions expected in a viva.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- The user can read the guide and follow the steps to verify the project runs as expected.
- The commands provided will be based on the project's README and confirmed file structure.
